# MA-Thesis
Help.
Please let me know if there are any bugs. No there is no ending yet. The ending will be a nice holistic collection about mnemonic resistance etc.<br></br>
The invisible work that has been done and is not apparent:
<li>I have used a free (and Creative Commons) javascript library for the audio. I have tested the functionality needed for my game and it works. Credits are in the twine code.</li>
<li>I have started work on the audiovisual assets.</li>
<li>I have spent time structuring out and planning the thesis so I can focus more on just writing next term. You will also see in the .docx some items that have been written out for chapters not currently in the game.</li>
<br></br>I am also aware the .docx is a mess, but that is because it is my rough draft/planning document. I put it here so that if you wanted to comment your feedback on the writing you could do so with a traditional format. It only has the item descriptions, not the full game text.
